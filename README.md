Landing Page for Bank with Credit and Deposit Simulation
This landing page is designed for a bank and features a simple credit simulation tool that allows users to input the loan amount, 
desired loan term, and credit type. Upon submission, the tool calculates the monthly payment and total refund amount and displays them to the user. 
Additionally, the page includes a deposit form where users can specify the deposit type, currency, amount, and deposit term.
